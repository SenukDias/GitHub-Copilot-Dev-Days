### 🗓️ Event formats

**GitHub Copilot Dev Days** are flexible - please tailor the format to fit your community! We recommend using one of the following **two formats**, depending on your community’s experience, audience, **and available infrastructure**.

**1️⃣ Sessions-only format:** Focused on technical talks and demos around GitHub Copilot.

**2️⃣ Sessions + Workshop format:** Combines technical sessions with a hands-on workshop for deeper, practical learning.

Both formats are designed to be interactive and hands-on, encouraging participants to learn by doing.
